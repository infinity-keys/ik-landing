          Infinity Keys, Inc. (“Infinity Keys”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) is
          committed to protecting your privacy. We have prepared this Privacy
          Policy to describe to you our practices regarding the Personal Data
          (as defined below) we collect, use, and share in connection with the
          Infinity Keys website provided on or in connection with our services.
          “NFT” in this Privacy Policy means a non-fungible token or similar
          digital item implemented on a blockchain (such as the Ethereum
          blockchain), which uses smart contracts to link to or otherwise be
          associated with certain content or data.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-6">Types of Data We Collect.</p>
        <p className="mt-6">
          “Personal Data” means data that allows someone to identify you
          individually, including, for example, email address, as well as any
          other non-public information about you that is associated with or
          linked to any of the foregoing. “Anonymous Data” means data, including
          aggregated and de-identified data, that is not associated with or
          linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not, by itself,
          permit the identification of individual persons. We collect Personal
          Data and Anonymous Data as described below.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-6">Information You Provide Us.</p>
        <p className="mt-6">
          When you use our Service or contact us we may collect Personal Data
          from you, such as email address, first and last name, and other
          information you provide. We also collect your blockchain address,
          which may become associated with Personal Data when you use our
          Service.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-6">
          Our Service lets you store preferences like how your content is
          displayed, notification settings, and favorites. We may associate
          these choices with your ID, browser, or mobile device.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-6">
          If you provide us with feedback or contact us, we will collect your
          name and contact information, as well as any other content included in
          the message. We may also collect Personal Data at other points in our
          Service where you voluntarily provide it or where we state that
          Personal Data is being collected.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-6">Information Collected via Technology.</p>
        <p className="mt-6">
          As you navigate through and interact with our Service, we may use
          automatic data collection technologies to collect certain information
          about your equipment, browsing actions, and patterns, including:
          Information Collected by Our Servers. To provide our Service and make
          it more useful to you, we (or a third party service provider) collect
          information from you, including, but not limited to, your browser
          type, operating system, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, mobile
          device ID, blockchain address, wallet type, and date/time stamps.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-6">Log Files.</p>
        <p className="mt-6">
          As is true of most websites and applications, we gather certain
          information automatically and store it in log files. This information
          includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider
          (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamps, and
          clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends,
          administer the Service, track users’ movements around the Service, and
          better tailor our Services to our users’ needs. For example, some of
          the information may be collected so that when you visit the Service,
          it will recognize you and the information can be used to personalize
          your experience.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-6">Cookies.</p>
        <p className="mt-6">
          Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. We
          may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web
          browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you
          delete them) to analyze how users interact with our Service, make
          improvements to our product quality, and provide users with a more
          personalized experience.

        <p className="mt-6">How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals.</p>
        <p className="mt-6">
          Our systems do not currently recognize “do not track” signals or other
          mechanisms that might enable Users to opt out of tracking on our site.

        <p className="mt-6">Analytics Services.</p>
        <p className="mt-6">
          In addition to the tracking technologies we place like Cookies, other
          companies may set their own cookies or similar tools when you visit
          our Service. This includes third-party analytics services (“Analytics
          Services”) that we engage to help analyze how users use the Service.
          The information generated by the Cookies or other technologies about
          your use of our Service (the “Analytics Information”) is transmitted
          to the Analytics Services. The Analytics Services use Analytics
          Information to compile reports on user activity, which we may receive
          on an individual or aggregate basis. We use the information we get
          from Analytics Services to improve our Service. The Analytics Services
          may also transfer information to third parties where required to do so
          by law, or where such third parties process Analytics Information on
          their behalf. Each Analytics Services’ ability to use and share
          Analytics Information is restricted by such Analytics Services’ terms
          of use and privacy policy. By using our Service, you consent to the
          processing of data about you by Analytics Services in the manner and
          for the purposes set out above.

        <p className="mt-6">
          We may receive Personal and/or Anonymous Data about you from companies
          that offer their products and/or services for use in conjunction with
          our Service or whose products and/or services may be linked from our
          Service. For example, third-party wallet providers provide us with
          your blockchain address and certain other information you choose to
          share with those wallets providers. We may add this to the data we
          have already collected from or about you through our Service.
