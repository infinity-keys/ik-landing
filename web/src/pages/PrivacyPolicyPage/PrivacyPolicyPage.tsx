          Infinity Keys, Inc. (“Infinity Keys”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) is
          committed to protecting your privacy. We have prepared this Privacy
          Policy to describe to you our practices regarding the Personal Data
          (as defined below) we collect, use, and share in connection with the
          Infinity Keys website provided on or in connection with our services.
          “NFT” in this Privacy Policy means a non-fungible token or similar
          digital item implemented on a blockchain (such as the Ethereum
          blockchain), which uses smart contracts to link to or otherwise be
          associated with certain content or data.

        <p className="mt-6">Types of Data We Collect.</p>
        <p className="mt-6">
          “Personal Data” means data that allows someone to identify you
          individually, including, for example, email address, as well as any
          other non-public information about you that is associated with or
          linked to any of the foregoing. “Anonymous Data” means data, including
          aggregated and de-identified data, that is not associated with or
          linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not, by itself,
          permit the identification of individual persons. We collect Personal
          Data and Anonymous Data as described below.

          When you use our Service or contact us we may collect Personal Data
          from you, such as email address, first and last name, and other

          Our Service lets you store preferences like how your content is

          Information Collected by Our Servers. To provide our Service and make
          it more useful to you, we (or a third party service provider) collect

          includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider
          (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamps, and
          clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends,
          administer the Service, track users&apos; movements around the
          Service, and better tailor our Services to our users&apos; needs. For
          example, some of the information may be collected so that when you

        <p className="mt-6">Cookies.</p>
        <p className="mt-6">
          Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. We
          may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web

          Use of Google and Discord OAuth for Secure Sign-In
        </p>

        <p className="mt-6">1. Introduction to OAuth Sign-In</p>
        <p className="mt-6">
          In our commitment to maintaining the security and ease of access to
          our services, we have integrated Google and Discord OAuth sign-in
          mechanisms, facilitated by Clerk. This integration is designed to
          streamline your login process and enhance the security of your
          account.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-6">2. How OAuth Sign-In Works</p>
        <p className="mt-6">
          When you choose to sign in using your Google or Discord account, you
          are authorizing our application to access basic profile information
          from these platforms. This process is managed through Clerk, a trusted
          third-party service, ensuring a secure and seamless authentication
          experience.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-6">3. Data Privacy and Security</p>
        <p className="mt-6">
          We take your privacy seriously and adhere to strict data protection
          standards. Here&apos;s what you need to know about the data involved
          in the OAuth sign-in process:
        </p>
        <p className="mt-6">
          <b>No Storage of OAuth Credentials</b>: We do not store any
          credentials associated with your Google or Discord accounts. The OAuth
          process only provides us with verification of your identity and the
          necessary basic profile information to facilitate the sign-in process.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-6">
          <b>Limited Data Access</b>: The only information accessed during this
          process is your email address and basic profile details required for
          authentication. We do not have access to any other data from your
          Google or Discord accounts.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-6">
          <b>Data Usage</b>: The information obtained through OAuth is solely
          used to establish and maintain your account on our platform. It is not
          used for any other purposes without your explicit consent.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-6">4. Revoking Access</p>
        <p className="mt-6">
          You maintain full control over the permissions granted. At any point,
          you can revoke our application&apos;s access to your Google or Discord
          information through your respective account settings on those
          platforms.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-6">5. Security Measures</p>
        <p className="mt-6">
          We, along with Clerk, implement robust security measures to protect
          the integrity and confidentiality of your data during the
          authentication process. However, we encourage you to review the
          privacy policies of Google and Discord to understand how they manage
          your data.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-6">6. Changes to this Policy</p>
        <p className="mt-6">
          This section of the privacy policy may be updated to reflect any
          changes in the way we use Google and Discord OAuth. We recommend
          reviewing this policy periodically for any updates.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-6">Analytics Services.</p>
        <p className="mt-6">
          In addition to the tracking technologies we place like Cookies, other
          companies may set their own cookies or similar tools when you visit
          our Service. This includes third-party analytics services (“Analytics
          Services”) that we engage to help analyze how users use the Service.
          The information generated by the Cookies or other technologies about
          your use of our Service (the “Analytics Information”) is transmitted
          to the Analytics Services. The Analytics Services use Analytics
          Information to compile reports on user activity, which we may receive
          on an individual or aggregate basis. We use the information we get
          from Analytics Services to improve our Service. The Analytics Services
          may also transfer information to third parties where required to do so
          by law, or where such third parties process Analytics Information on
          their behalf. Each Analytics Services&apos; ability to use and share
          Analytics Information is restricted by such Analytics Services&apos;
          terms of use and privacy policy. By using our Service, you consent to
          the processing of data about you by Analytics Services in the manner
          and for the purposes set out above.

          We care about the security of your information and use physical,
          administrative, and technological safeguards to preserve the integrity
          and security of information collected through our Service. However, no
          security system is impenetrable and we cannot guarantee the security
          of our systems. In the event that any information under our custody
          and control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we
          will take steps to investigate and remediate the situation and, in
          accordance with applicable laws and regulations, notify those
          individuals whose information may have been compromised.

          We do not intentionally gather Personal Data from visitors who are
          under the age of 13. Minors who are at least 13 years old but are

          account, but only with the involvement of the account holder. If a
          child under 13 submits Personal Data to Infinity Keys and we learn
          that the Personal Data is the information of a child under 13, we will
          attempt to delete the information as soon as possible. If you believe
          that we might have any Personal Data from a child under 13, please
          contact us by using the “Submit a request” link at the address
